These are two games that were personal projects that my friend and I worked on. These were for game jams, which are events where programmers are given a limited amount of time to develop a game, usually with a unique theme that is revealed at the start of the jam. Both of these projects were built in Godot, an engine for building games that also uses C# code.

The first game was for Discord Jam 5, and the theme was Mutation. The game is a shooter where your character gets mutations each time you die. My friend did almost all of the coding for this project, whereas I helped out with the game design and the ‘art’.

The second game was for Mini Jam 73, and the theme was power. The game is a puzzle game where a robot must fix a circuit to generate power for itself. For this game I was a lot more involved, although my friend still did most of the coding and work in Godot.
