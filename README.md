  Hello! This is my reflection and signature work portfolio for the University of Saint Thomas. I will briefly go over a few of the projects that I have worked on through my time at UST.

**1. My Personal Website** In my web development class, I made a personal website.

**2. Dynamic Server** Another project from my web development class, this project demonstrates using SQL queries to dynamically update a webpage.

**3. Games** Two personal projects that I worked on with a friend are games that we made during game jams.
