This is a project from my web development class that allows you to generate lists of crimes in areas around St. Paul. There are two pages on the website: a landing page that includes the map and filter, and an about page with information about me and my teammates for the project.

The website allows you to search by location, or filter by incidents, neighborhoods, and time. There is a map that you can interact with, and a list of all crimes below the map that includes all of the crimes that fit within the selected filters.

To run this website we used node.js, and would run ‘node .\server.js’ to see the website on http://localhost:8000/index.html.

The point of this project was to have a RESTful API Server that can access information stored on a database. My contribution to the project was a lot of the front end styling, and the javascript code to generate the filtered list efficiently.
