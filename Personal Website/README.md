This is a personal website that I made in CISC 375 - Web Development. The idea of this project is that a personal website is a really good way to have an online presence that is easy to show off who you are and what you have done. In a way, the goal of the website is very similar to a portfolio.

The website consists of four pages: a landing page, a projects page, a resume page, and a fun page.

The landing page consists of links to the other pages, a headshot of me, and a very brief description of who I am.

The projects page contains information about some projects I have worked on. It includes stuff about the game jams that me and my friend made and a song the I helped create.

The resume page includes information commonly found on a resume. This includes education, work experience, and extracurricular accomplishments.

The fun page consists of some memes and information about my hobbies.

In terms of coding, this was an introduction to frameworks, specifically the framework Foundation. I had to use a combination of html and css in combination with Foundation to make the website.
